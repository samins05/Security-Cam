# Security-Cam
security camera that uses grayscale images and haar cascade and LBF classifiers to detect if person on the camera that is detected is in the database. User will add people they know to a database and train the program by taking pictures of whoever they want to add, and anyone that appears on the camera that isn't in the database will be flagged UNKNOWN. **This will then send an alert to the program for the user to be notified(this will be added soon)**
